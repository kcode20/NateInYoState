				Nateinyostate is a passion project that got started at a young age of
				traveling and telling the world about it. It all started with a bike
				trip that I did with a high friend and cycling enthusiast, Will. We did
				an impromptu trip from The Bronx, New York all the way to Washington DC
				in 2009. But as I sit here writing this it goes deeper than that. It
				actually goes as far back to the 90s when I got my first bicycle living
				in the South Bronx. My parents always wanted to keep an eye on me so my
				range of motion was very limited back in the day. When I got that bike
				however I was able to go a little further with my parents permission.
				This was almost “liberating” as it opened the world around me.{' '}

				As I got more involved in cycling, Will and I started to cycle from The
				Bronx all the way down to Chinatown in Manhattan. This was just for fun
				at first, but we made it into a thing to bike to Chinatown whenever we
				were hungry because the Chinese food there was genuine compared to our
				neighborhoods. New York couldn't contain our appetite to explore new
				places to cycle and we biked into New Jersey. After we conquered another
				state, personally I wanted to go further; pushing my limits. Will
				jokingly suggested we go to D.C and I said “Yeah, let's do it!” and
				within a few days we were on our way.{' '}

				After a health scare in 2018, I realized how short life is and made a
				balance on eating right as well as sharing unique places to eat. I took
				traveling and exploring more seriously. I want to see as much of the
				world as I can and I set out on a journey to enjoy the things I love.
				Food, Travel, and Tech. I hope to continue having me aboard on this
				journey.
